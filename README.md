# Project
Push Swap is one of the three projects in the 42 program third circle, It is the first sorting algorithm of the students and are noted on the amount of operation required to sort a stack of int using only 2 stacks and some basic operations.

# Constraints
According to the subject there is 2 contraints for this project:
*  The global variables are prohibited.
*  The whole files of the projects need to follow 42 norm ([Link](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf))

# External function(s) allowed
* read

# Behavior

## Argument(s)
* A list of int passed as the program arguments 

## Output
* Print the functions used to sort the list passsed as arguments.
* Print Error in case of error in argument parsing. 

# Bonus part
| Description | Mark |
|      --     |:----:|
| Make a tester that take a list of int as argument and exectute the sorting instructions. | :x: |


# Usage

``make`` to compile.

``make clean`` to clean all compiled files without the program.

``make fclean`` to clean all compiled files with the program.

``make re`` to fclean then make.

``./push_swap 5 4 3 2 1``
